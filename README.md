# Alteryx Workflow for the Tableau Metadata API

This is the Alteryx Workflow that I built for the two blog posts that you can find here:

- [What is the Metadata API?](https://andredevries.dev/posts/graphql-metadata-tableau/)
- [How to connect to the Metadata API in Alteryx?](https://andredevries.dev/posts/graphql-metadata-alteryx/)

You can download the repository by clicking the Green Download button on the top right.
